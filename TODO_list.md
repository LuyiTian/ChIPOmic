##TODO list

1. calculate p-value by random simulation- distribution inequality

2. find peaks that lies with -1000~1000bp relative to TSS of each gene
3. linear regression: peak width ~ gene expression and peak signal value ~ gene expression
4. find potential relationship between averaged peak width and chromatin remodeling factor
